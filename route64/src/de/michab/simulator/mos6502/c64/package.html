Here's the place where the classes are placed that are responsible for
implementing a real computer system -- the Commodore 64. On an abstract level
the classes contained in this package are the integrating glue for the classes
contained in the mos6502 package.  Missing pieces like keyboard or joystick
emulations are placed here.  The class
{@link de.michab.simulator.mos6502.c64.C64Core C64Core} represents the single
facade class that acts as the interface between the core emulation and potential
user interface implementations.
