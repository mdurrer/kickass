Added memory editor for debugging support.  Switched to Jdk1.4.

rel-20050708-route64

Invested more work in timing.  Stuff got simpler and more exact.
Refactored sound.  Fixed problems with undocumented opcodes in
processor emulation.

rel-20050227-route64

Completely reworked timing.  The new timing performs a much more
detailed emulation of the original system.  System load went up with the new
(nearly) cycle-exact timing, being exact means needing more brain-, eh, 
processor cycles.  Many timing dependend games behave better now.
As a side effect we could throw out a lot of now obsolete code that
had in the past the goal to control system load.  Internally some non-
intuitive behaviour remains, but this will be resolved over the next releases.

rel-20050117-route64

Fixed relative addressing modes and cycle timing in the processor 
emulation.  Fixed possibility of deadlock for certain CIA programming
sequences.

rel-20041211-route64

Reset is now always hard, i.e. also re-initialising the reset-vector.  This
allows to reset even if a programme modified the reset vector.
Additional image file format .PRG is now supported.

rel-20040817-route64

Added sound support.  Wow and thanks, Joakime.
UI Rework: Added new icons, some from Eclipse.org, some newly made.
Added Games Gallery to documentation.

rel-20040605-route64

Added Applet support: Applet class is de.michab.apps.route64.Commodore64Applet.
Finally fixed defect 409221.  That took three years!  Now happily  running on
multiprocessor systems.

rel-20040213-route64

UI changes:
 Added mack menu components.  Cool menu/toolbar system now.
 Dropped JDK1.2 support.
Rework of debugger internals.
Fixes for 740949:
 Video screen drawing is now dynamically adapting to available
 system speed.
 Processor cycles are kept in realtime sync.
Addition of feature 722421: Keyboard support now solid, simple and
straightforward:  The keys just result in the characters that are
printed on them.

rel-20030610-route64

Fixed sprite size register mapping.  Register numbers were wrong.
For the next releases we have to concentrate on clockspeed control.

rel-020827-route64

Fixed resize problem.
Started restructuring towards better clock emulation and activity dispatch.
This is pretty experimental.

rel-011229-route64

Beefed up and completed the documentation as a web site.  First steps
towards full WebStart capability.  Many minor cleanups -- in total a
major cleanup.

rel-011202-route64

Fixed jdk1.4 problems with focus and key handling.  Implemented a
workaround since the defect on bug parade develops into a pattern
that makes me believe it will never get fixed.  Focus handling
seems to break down because of its own complexity.

rel-160901-route64

Fixed reference to jdk1.3 specific classes.  Route64 keeps on jdk1.2.
Removed javadoc warnings.

rel-020601-route64

Fixed problems in t64 loader.
Added p00 loader.
Reworked load dialog filters.
Reworked screen rasterizing, solved problem with raster polling.
Added message bar.
Fixed function key mappings.
Changed STOP and RESTORE key mappings.

rel-010501-route64

Debugger system is integrated.
Finally can be deployed in compressed jar file.

rel-010416-route64

.t64 load format is now supported.
Drag and drop loading of image files.
New Swing based UI.
Joystick input restructured.
System load is reduced while waiting for characters.

rel-010316-route64

Restructured towards a cooler UI in the future.
Fixed problem with 0x1000 and 0x8000 character mapping -> 
  Galaga / The Hobbit now work.  Big impact.
Restructured C64Memory and cleaned up.  No longer redundant loading.
