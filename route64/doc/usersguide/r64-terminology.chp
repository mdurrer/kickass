<p>This chapter explains the terminology used around the Commodore 64 
and Route 64.</p>

<h3>Peripherals</h3>

<p>The Commodore 64 supported two types of persistent storage, either casette 
tape or 5 1/4 inch floppy disks.  The tape device was called <I>Datasette</I>
and was notoriously unrelieable.  The floppy disk device was called the
<I>Commodore 1541</I> floppy drive.  It supported single-sided, low density 
floppies holding around 160k worth of data.  While the 1541 was a bit expensive
&#8211; it cost about the same as the Commodore 64 itself &#8211; it developed 
to the
normal storage device that most people owned.  Later there where additional 
periphereals that supported larger disk sizes like the <I>Commodore 1571</I> 
but these never reached the same level of acceptance like the 1541.</p>

<p>These peripherals are simulated in Route 64 behind the scenes, Route 64 is
equipped with a Datasette and a floppy drive out of the box.  The
visible concept is the <i>attachment</i> of an image file to the
emulator.  The image files are available on the internet and implicitely
define the type of periphery.  For example the wiedly used <i>.d64</i>
files represent a Commodore 1541 disk image, while <i>.t64</i> files
are Datasette tape images.</p>

<h3>Commodore 64 Chips</h3>

<p>Internally the Commodore had some custom chips that were developed
by <i>MOS Technologies</i>, a chip factory owned by Commodore.  The most
prominent chips in the Commodore 64 were the VIC and the SID.
VIC was short for <i>Video Interface Chip</i>, a friendly name for a chip
originally called <i>MOS65xx</i>.  This chip was
repsonsible for the impressive graphics capabilities of the 64.</p>

<p>SID stood for <I>Sound Interface Device</I>, officially named
<I>MOS 65xx</I>, which was responsible for the sound.  The sound
capabilities were similarly impressive as the graphics capabilities.</p>

<p>Other chips that sometimes are referred to are the CIA chips.  CIA
is <i>Complex Input/Output Adapter</i> and the 64 had a pair of them,
being responsible for a range of tasks including keyboard input,
timer interrupts and joystick handling.</p>
