<p>It is possible to use Route 64 as an Applet and to integrate it into a Web
page.  The applet supports the configuration of an image file and the start of
certain programs in that image.  As a consequence it is easy to put up
Route 64 with your favourite game from the eighties...</p>

<p>Note that the Route 64 applet adds about 150k to the web page that offers
access to it.  Make sure that the additional traffic is ok.  To be able to view 
the Web page with the applet it is recommended to use the Sun Java Plug-In.</p>

<p>To integrate the Route 64 Applet into your web site first download the
standard archive from SourceForge and place the .jar file on your Web server.
The following lists the required data for the html applet tag:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>name</code><br/>
    The name can be freely chosen, e.g. "route64".</li>
<li><code>code</code><br/>
    The starter class is 
    <code>de.michab.apps.route64.Commodore64Applet.class</code></li>
<li><code>archive</code><br/>
    This has to refer to the position of the downloaded Route 64 .jar file
    on your web server, an example is
    <code>applets/route64-&lt;build id&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>width</code><br/>
    Set the width to 380 pixels.</li>
<li><code>height</code><br/>
    The recommended height is 290 pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following parameters are supported by the applet:</p>

<table 
  border="2" 
  cellpadding="2" 
  cellspacing="0" 
  summary="Parameters supported by the Route 64 applet.">
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>image</code></td>
    <td>An optional parameter defining the image file to be loaded.  This is a 
    relative name that is resolved against the applet's document base.  If your 
    image is located in the same directory as the web page specify the plain
    name.  If it is located elsewhere specify the relative path name.  If this 
    parameter is not specified then no image file will be attached.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>start</code></td>
    <td>The name of a file that is contained in the image and that should be
    loaded and started.  This parameter is optional and is only used if 
    the <code>image</code> parameter is set as well.  If <code>start</code> is
    not set, but a file is attached, then no program is started 
    automatically.  Instead the user can manually LOAD and RUN the file.</td>
  </tr><tr>
   <td><code>device</code></td>
   <td>The input device to be used. Optional, if not set then the keyboard is
   the default setting.  Set to '0' (zero) to use the keyboard.  Set to '1' or
   '2' to use joystick one or two, respectively.</td>
  </tr>
