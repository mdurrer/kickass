<p>Route 64 is a Commodore 64 emulator.  It is written in Java and should
thus be highly portable.  You can use it to either play around on the
BASIC command line that the 64 had or to get some game images and play
games again that you missed for a long time.</p>

<p>This emulator supports enough of the Commodore 64's features to be
able to actually run more complex games.  It emulates the video chip VIC, the 
IO and timer chips (CIAs) and finally even the sound chip.</p>

<p>Note that Route 64 is not perfect. It is also not a cycle-exact simulation 
of the Commodore 64 which is the main reason that some games found on the 
internet are not working.  But it's getting better all the time...</p>
