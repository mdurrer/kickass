<p>Route 64 supports two different installation scenarios. The first
one, a Java WebStart based installation, does not require a client
side installation at all; code and required libraries are
automatically downloaded from the internet on demand and cached by
the WebStart client side. The advantage of this kind of installation
is that WebStart automatically takes care for downloading and
managing updates which includes dowload and installation of required
system components like JDK and JavaHelp. The disadvantage of WebStart
is that certain functionality of Route 64 is disabled when running
under WebStart control. The most visible feature that is not
available in Java WebStart is Drag and Drop loading.</p>

<p>The alternate option to install Route 64 is also not too
complicated: Download Route 64 from the SouceForge download area. On
the download page normally the last 5 release levels of Route 64 can
be downloaded, normally you should select just the newest version.
Store the downloaded file wherever you like. The file you got from
the download is an <i>executable jar</i> file, i.e. it supports a
simplified form of execution based on your operating system.</p>

<!-- &#8211; is &ndash; -->

<p>The simplest &#8211; and least comfortable &#8211; possibility to
start Route 64 from the downloaded file is to use the following
command line in a shell:</p>

<p><code>java -jar route64-&lt;buildnumber&gt;.jar</code></p>

<p>Note that the actual name of the jar file contains a version
number. The full file name has to be specified on the command line.
The more convenient possibility to start Route 64 uses the fact that
on many operating systems the .jar file type is automatically tied to
the execution of the Java virtual machine. If this is the case on
your OS, then this means that you just have to navigate in your file
manager to the dowloaded file and perform a double-click.</p>

<p>Installing Java on a Windows system results in the necessary file
associations so that the above works, other operating systems should
provide similar functionality. If you cannot get Route64 to run from
your file manager, use the command line or WebStart as described
above.</p>
